This is an R Project that uses the Bookdown package to develop a lab manual for Introduction to Statistics (STAT 202) with Prof. Arend Kuyper. 

## Prerequisites
- An installation of the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) IDE for R programming
- An installation of the [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) R package
- A GitHub account

## Get Started
- Open RStudio
- Create a New Project `File -> New Project...`
- Select `Version Control`
- Choose 'Git'
- Enter `https://github.com/nulib/kuyper-stat202.git` as the repository URL
- Clone the repository into a directory on your computer
- The cloning process will require you enter in your GitHub username and password

## Contributing
Cloning projects with Git will create local copies of the files of a GitHub repository onto your computer. Git automatically tracks changes you make to the local files, which you can then push to the repository on GitHub. All of this can be done from the `Git` tab in the `Environment` window. 

**Here is a basic Git workflow:**
1. Edit project files on your computer
2. Commit the changes you've made to the files to your local code repository
3. Push the commit from your local code repository to the GitHub code repository

**Make a commit**
- Edit files in the project and save the changes
- Click on the check box in the staged column for the changes you want to include in the commit
- click on the `Commit` button in the `Git` tab
- Write a brief commit message (e.g. `Updates the README with instructions on contributing to the project`)
