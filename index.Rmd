# Preface {-}

These lab exercises supplement the third edition of [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/index.php) textbook. Each lab steps through the process of using the R programming language for collecting, analyzing, and using statistical data to make inferences and conclusions about real world phenomena.

This version of the labs have been modified by [Arend Kuyper](https://www.statistics.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/arend-m-kuyper.html) to include new datasets and examples for introductory statistics courses at Northwestern University. Visit [Labs for R](https://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php) at OpenIntro for the original materials.

The chapters in this book were adapted from labs originally written by Mark Hansen and adapted for OpenIntro by Andrew Bray and Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel.
