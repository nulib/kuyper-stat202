# Preface {-} 

These lab exercises supplement the third edition of [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/index.php) textbook. Each lab steps through the process of using the R programming language for collecting, analyzing, and using statistical data to make inferences and conclusions about real world phenomena. Many of the labs have been modified by Arenda Kuyper to include new datasets and examples. Visit [Labs for R](https://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php) at OpenIntro for the original material.
